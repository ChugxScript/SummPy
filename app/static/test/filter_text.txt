The questions given
to the user are based on the user data to the database and to the current game By providing a gamified and interactive learning environment, the webgame has the
potential to significantly enhance educational outcomes and support academic achievement in
Grade 10 algebra.
In summary, the ALGE-BRUH webgame demonstrates strong performance, effective
design, robust functionality, and positive user experience, contributing to its overall effectiveness
and impact as an educational tool The ability to manage extensive data and offer real-time
analytics further enhances the functionality, making the webgame a comprehensive tool for
learning and assessment.
User experience is a central focus of the ALGE-BRUH webgame, with a significant
portion of the evaluation dedicated to assessing student satisfaction and engagement This is where the user signs
in their account and the webgame will authenticate the given action and redirect the user to the
appropriate page.

Figure 8 The user-friendly
interface and engaging game design contribute significantly to these positive outcomes,
suggesting that the webgame successfully fosters an enjoyable learning environment.
The impact of the ALGE-BRUH webgame on students’ learning experiences is
substantial Dashboard
Figure 8 visually displays the dashboard page where it displays the various actions that the user
can perform such as viewing the profile where it display the updated user status and other details
such as username, viewing inventory where it displays the current characters and items that the
user have, taking lessons by clicking the journey and pick which stage or lesson that the user can
take, viewing the shop where the user can find available characters and items that the user can
purchase to make the webgame more entertaining and make the user more encage to the game.
Figure 9 The primary objective of this webgame is to provide an
effective method for assessing and engaging students' performance and learning, specifically in
the subject of Grade 10 algebra User-Friendly Interface: With a clean, intuitive interface, the webgame system ensures a
smooth user experience for students that is more aligned to ‘memes’ in the internet to
make the user entertain and engage.
3 The next question
will depend on the current difficulty level of the question, the time that the user answered the
question, and if the answer is answered correctly or not using DTTS algorithm.
Project Capabilities and Limitations
The following are the capabilities of the developed system:
1 The actual web-based
educational game will be diligently developed with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript, paying close
attention to the decision to use Bootstrap or React to improve the user interface design and user
experience overall Real-time Analytics: The System offers real-time analytics capabilities to monitor and
analyze student performance and progress over time and for the DTTS algorithm to give
appropriate action to the user during the gameplay.
Just like any other systems, the system has the following limitations:
1 By providing continuous feedback
38ALGE-BRUH
and a gamified learning environment, the system aims to foster academic excellence and support
student success.
Upon completion, ALGE-BRUH will offer students a web game powered by the DTTS
algorithm, enabling them to evaluate their performance and progress in algebra However,
the system's performance is highly dependent on a steady internet connection, which could be a
limitation in areas with inadequate internet infrastructure.

CHAPTER 4
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
This chapter discusses the project description, project structure, project capabilities and
limitations, and project evaluation.
Project Description
The project involves the development of a web-based game system named
ALGE-BRUH, designed to integrate the Decision Tree Thompson Sampling (DTTS) algorithm
into gamified educational content The
adaptability of the website for both phone and desktop use is crucial for its accessibility, although
specific details on its mobile optimization are not extensively covered in the provided document.
The functionality of the ALGE-BRUH webgame is robust, offering several features to
support educational engagement By
engaging with the game, students are reminded of and can enhance their knowledge of Grade 10
algebra topics The system allows students to track their progress through
detailed statistics, including the number of correct and incorrect answers, time taken to answer
questions, and more Data Management: The System can manage a vast amount of data related to students,
including their owned characters and items, days active, username, stage cleared, and
user stats such as total answer time, game currency, bonus, easy, and difficult questions
taken, correct and incorrect answers, level, and score.
2 Firebase is utilized for database management and web
hosting, ensuring the webgame is accessible online.
ALGE-BRUH offers an interactive platform where students can track their progress and
performance This setup ensures that the webgame is
accessible online and capable of managing a vast amount of data related to student performance
